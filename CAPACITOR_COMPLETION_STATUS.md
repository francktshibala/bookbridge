## üéØ Current Status: iOS TestFlight Deployment (95% Complete - Day 13/14)

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-06 4:57 PM

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Certificate & Code Signing Issues
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Certificate keychain location issue (moved from System to login keychain)
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Apple Distribution certificate now properly paired with private key
- ‚úÖ **WORKING**: Certificate appears in "My Certificates" tab with key icon
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: New provisioning profile "BookBridge TestFlight 2025" created and working
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Xcode archive process now works without signing errors
- ‚úÖ **GENERATED**: Valid .ipa file successfully exported for distribution

### üö´ Current Blocker: Apple SDK Version Requirement
**Issue:** Apple now requires iOS 18 SDK (Xcode 16+) for TestFlight uploads
**Error:** "This app was built with the iOS 17.2 SDK. All iOS and iPadOS apps must be built with the iOS 18 SDK or later"

**System Limitation:** 
- Current: macOS Ventura 13.7.6 + Xcode 15.2 (iOS 17.2 SDK)
- Required: macOS Sequoia 15.3+ + Xcode 16+ (iOS 18 SDK)
- Hardware: 2017 iMac may support macOS upgrade

**Attempted Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Tried iOS deployment target change (16.0) - didn't work
- ‚úÖ Tried Transporter app upload - same SDK validation
- ‚úÖ Tried custom export options - same validation

**Implementation: 95% Complete (13.5/14 days)**

‚úÖ All core functionality implemented
‚úÖ Web app remains fully functional  
‚úÖ iOS builds and runs successfully with safe area fixes
‚úÖ Android builds and internal testing completed successfully
‚úÖ Production server connectivity confirmed
‚úÖ **Certificate and signing issues completely resolved**
‚úÖ **Archive and .ipa generation working perfectly**
‚ùå **Upload blocked by Apple's iOS 18 SDK requirement only**

## üéØ Resolution Path: macOS/Xcode Upgrade Required

**The Fix:** Update to macOS Sequoia 15.3+ and Xcode 16 to get iOS 18 SDK

**What's Ready:**
- All signing certificates and provisioning profiles working perfectly
- App archives successfully without any errors  
- .ipa file is valid and properly signed
- Only upload validation fails due to SDK version

**Next Steps for Completion:**
1. **Check macOS compatibility** - verify 2017 iMac supports Sequoia 15.3+
2. **Update macOS** to Sequoia 15.3 or later
3. **Install Xcode 16** from Mac App Store (requires macOS 15.3+)
4. **Re-archive with iOS 18 SDK** (1 command: Product ‚Üí Archive)
5. **Upload to TestFlight** (will succeed immediately)

**Alternative:** Use newer Mac with macOS 15.3+ for final upload step only

### üìÅ Working Branch
- Current work on: `ios-testflight-deployment`  
- Safety backup: `ios-testflight-backup`
- **DO NOT COMMIT** until TestFlight upload succeeds
