## üéØ Current Status: iOS TestFlight Deployment (90% Complete - Day 13/14)

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-06 5:45 AM

### ‚úÖ Major Progress - Certificate & Profile Setup
- Apple Developer Program account active and configured
- App Store Connect app record created: "BookBridge ESL" 
- Bundle ID confirmed: com.bookbridge.app
- App builds successfully in simulator and production integration works
- Added required privacy descriptions (NSMicrophoneUsageDescription)
- 1024x1024 App Store icon properly configured

### üîß Current Challenge - Code Signing for TestFlight
**Problem:** Provisioning profile and certificate linking issues preventing archive

**Root Cause:** Certificate-to-provisioning-profile association not working despite:
- ‚úÖ Apple Distribution certificate installed with private key (expires Sep 6, 2026)
- ‚úÖ Multiple provisioning profiles created: "Francois Tshibala BookBridge Profile"  
- ‚ùå Xcode still shows: "Provisioning profile doesn't include signing certificate"

**Implementation: 90% Complete (13/14 days)**

‚úÖ All core functionality implemented
‚úÖ Web app remains fully functional  
‚úÖ iOS builds and runs successfully with safe area fixes
‚úÖ Android builds and internal testing completed successfully
‚úÖ Production server connectivity confirmed

## üéØ Next Session Priority - Certificate/Profile Resolution

**Issue to Resolve:** 
Certificate and provisioning profile are properly created but not linking in Xcode. Despite having:
- Valid Apple Distribution certificate with private key in Keychain
- Properly configured App Store provisioning profile
- Both created with matching CSR and team (6Z8DF9BC32)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Investigate certificate selection during profile creation** - verify exact certificate was selected
2. **Try alternative certificate creation methods** (Xcode vs manual vs Transporter)
3. **Test with different provisioning profile configurations**
4. **Consider using Xcode automatic signing** if manual continues to fail
5. **Archive and upload to TestFlight** once signing resolves

**Backup Plan:** Research indicates this is a common issue with multiple solutions documented in community forums

### üìÅ Working Branch
- Current work on: `ios-testflight-deployment`  
- Safety backup: `ios-testflight-backup`
- **DO NOT COMMIT** until TestFlight upload succeeds
