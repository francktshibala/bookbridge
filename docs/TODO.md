## PHASE 4: Future Growth & Publisher Partnerships (Post-Launch)

### Technical Issues & Future Improvements

**üîß Standard Ebooks API Authentication Issue**
- **Status**: Temporarily disabled (401 Unauthorized errors)
- **Details**: Standard Ebooks OPDS feed now requires authentication that we don't have
- **Impact**: Minimal - only affects 500 books out of 20M+ total available
- **Current Sources Working**:
  - ‚úÖ Project Gutenberg: 76,000+ books
  - ‚úÖ Open Library: 1.4M+ books  
  - ‚úÖ Google Books: 20M+ books
- **Future Fix Options**:
  - [ ] Contact Standard Ebooks for API access credentials
  - [ ] Implement OAuth if they provide authentication method
  - [ ] Alternative: Parse their public catalog page instead of OPDS feed
- **Code Location**: Commented out in `/app/library/page.tsx` lines 148-172
