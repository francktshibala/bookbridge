- [x] Build function to ask AI a question
- [x] Build function to score the response
- [x] Build function to save results
- [x] Test with one simple question

### Step 3: Create test questions (1 hour) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `lib/benchmarking/data/test-questions.json`
- [x] Add 20-30 literature questions with correct answers
- [x] Include mix of difficulty levels
- [x] Test questions work with current AI

### Step 4: Run daily tests (15 mins to set up) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create script to test 10 random questions daily
- [x] Set up logging system for results
- [x] Create simple dashboard to view scores
- [x] Set threshold: AI must score above 85%

### Step 5: Advanced Features ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **R.A.C.C.C.A. Framework** - 6-dimensional scoring (95/100 average)
- [x] **Advanced Test Runner** - Sophisticated analysis with AI evaluation
- [x] **Question Generator** - AI-powered database expansion system
- [x] **Expert Export** - Results formatted for PhD professor review

### Step 6: Add to UI (optional)
- [ ] Add "AI Quality Score: 92%" badge to chat interface
- [ ] Show quality metrics on homepage
- [ ] Build user confidence with transparency

## Success Metrics
- [ ] System runs 10 tests daily without manual intervention
- [ ] AI consistently scores 85%+ on literature questions
- [ ] Quality scores are logged and trackable over time
- [ ] Foundation ready for expert validation phase

## Files to Create
1. `lib/benchmarking/test-runner.ts` - Core testing logic
2. `lib/benchmarking/data/test-questions.json` - Question database
3. `lib/benchmarking/scoring.ts` - Response scoring logic
4. `lib/benchmarking/logger.ts` - Results logging
5. `components/QualityBadge.tsx` - UI component (optional)

## Quick Start
Begin with Step 1 - just create the folder structure. Then move to Step 2 to build the basic test runner.
