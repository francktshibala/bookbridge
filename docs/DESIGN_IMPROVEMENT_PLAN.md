## 🎨 Design Principles

### Core Design Fundamentals (CRAP + Extensions)

#### **Contrast**
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between headings, body text, and UI elements
- **Color Contrast:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Size Contrast:** Significant differences between heading and body text sizes
- **Weight Contrast:** Strategic use of font weights (300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
- **Texture Contrast:** Smooth gradients vs solid colors, elevated cards vs flat surfaces

#### **Repetition**
- **Color System:** Consistent purple/blue gradient palette (#667eea, #764ba2) throughout
- **Typography Scale:** Repeated font sizes across all components (16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 36px, 56px)
- **Spacing System:** 8px grid system applied consistently (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- **Border Radius:** Consistent rounding (8px buttons, 12px inputs, 16px cards, 20-24px heroes)
- **Shadow Patterns:** Repeated elevation system (sm, md, lg, brand shadows)
- **Animation Timing:** Consistent durations (200ms micro, 300ms cards, 400ms modals)

#### **Alignment**
- **Grid Systems:** Consistent column alignment across all layouts
- **Text Alignment:** Strategic left/center alignment for optimal readability
- **Element Alignment:** Visual connections between related components
- **Edge Alignment:** Clean margins and consistent page boundaries
- **Baseline Alignment:** Text elements align to consistent baseline grid

#### **Proximity**
- **Related Grouping:** Related elements positioned close together (form fields, navigation items)
- **Section Separation:** Clear whitespace between distinct content areas
- **Component Spacing:** Consistent gaps between cards, buttons, and interactive elements
- **Content Hierarchy:** Logical spacing that guides user attention flow

#### **Balance**
- **Visual Weight:** Balanced distribution of elements across layouts
- **Asymmetrical Balance:** Strategic placement of heavy/light elements
- **Color Balance:** Harmonious distribution of brand colors and neutrals
- **Content Balance:** Appropriate text-to-whitespace ratios
- **Interactive Balance:** Even distribution of clickable elements

#### **Unity/Harmony**
- **Design Language:** Cohesive visual style across all pages and components
- **Brand Expression:** Consistent personality through color, typography, and interactions
- **Component Cohesion:** All UI elements feel like part of the same system
- **Content Integration:** Text, images, and UI work together seamlessly

### Visual Consistency Implementation
- **Color Palette:** Refined purple/blue gradients (#667eea, #764ba2) with supporting neutrals
- **Typography:** Inter font family with consistent sizing scale and weight hierarchy
- **Spacing:** 8px grid system for layouts, components, and micro-spacing
- **Border Radius:** 12px-16px for cards, 8px for buttons, 20px+ for hero sections
- **Shadows:** Layered shadow system (sm: 2-4px, md: 6-12px, lg: 16-32px, brand: colored)

### Animation Standards
- **Duration Hierarchy:** 200ms (micro), 300ms (components), 400ms (page transitions)
- **Easing Functions:** Smooth, natural cubic-bezier curves
- **Motion Purpose:** Enhance hierarchy, provide feedback, guide attention
