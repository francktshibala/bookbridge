## ESL-Optimized Control Bar Recommendations

### Recommended Minimal Control Bar
```
[B1] [Play/Pause Button] [1.0x] [2/5] [Menu]
```

**5 Elements Maximum:**
1. **Level Badge** (B1/B2/etc) - Shows current simplification level
2. **Play/Pause Button** - Large, primary action (64px minimum)
3. **Speed Control** - Tap to cycle (0.8x → 1.0x → 1.2x → 0.8x)
4. **Page Progress** - Simple fraction (2/5) with progress bar
5. **Menu Button** - Three dots for advanced options

### Advanced Options (Hidden in Menu)
- Voice provider selection
- Auto-advance toggle
- Highlighting on/off

- Night mode toggle

### Mobile Gesture Support
- **Tap left/right**: Previous/next page
- **Double-tap**: Play/pause
- **Pinch**: Text size adjustment
- **Swipe up**: Show/hide controls
- **Long press**: Word definition (vocabulary mode)

## Highlighting Approach for ESL Learners

### Word Highlighting Strategy
1. **During Audio**: Yellow highlight follows speech (current implementation works well)
2. **Vocabulary Mode**: Blue highlights for new/difficult words (CEFR level-based)
3. **Smooth Transitions**: 150ms transition timing for comfort
4. **High Contrast**: Ensure WCAG AA compliance for visibility

### Performance Requirements
- **<100ms gap** between audio chunks ✓ (already achieved)
- **Smooth highlighting**: No stuttering or jumps
- **Battery efficient**: Minimize DOM updates
- **Memory conscious**: Clean up highlighting sessions

### Provider-Specific Optimization
1. **Web Speech API** (Free, Instant):
   - Perfect word boundaries ✓
   - Use for ESL learners on budget
   - Immediate highlighting, no delay

2. **OpenAI + Whisper** (Premium, Accurate):
   - 90-95% accuracy with forced alignment
   - Best for challenging texts
   - 2-3 second processing delay acceptable

3. **ElevenLabs WebSocket** (Premium, Perfect):
   - 99% character-level accuracy
   - Use for advanced learners wanting perfection
   - Real-time streaming with instant highlighting

## Auto-Advance UX Recommendations

### Seamless Page Transitions
1. **Pre-load Next Page**: Load content 10 seconds before current page ends
2. **Smooth Visual Transition**: 300ms fade between pages
3. **Audio Continuity**: No gaps during page transitions
4. **Progress Indication**: Show loading state if needed
5. **User Control**: Easy pause/stop auto-advance

### Auto-Advance Controls
```
[Auto-Advance: ON] [Pause on Questions] [Speed: Normal]
```

**Settings:**
- **Auto-advance**: ON/OFF toggle
- **Pause behavior**: Continue automatically vs. pause at chapter breaks
- **Transition speed**: Fast (immediate) vs. Normal (300ms) vs. Slow (500ms)

### Error Handling
- **Network failures**: Cache next page, graceful fallback
- **Audio failures**: Auto-retry, switch to backup provider
- **User interruption**: Remember position, easy resume

## Mobile vs Desktop Design Differences

### Mobile-First Design (Primary)
- **Maximum 3 controls** visible simultaneously
- **Touch targets**: 44px minimum (iOS) / 48dp (Android)
