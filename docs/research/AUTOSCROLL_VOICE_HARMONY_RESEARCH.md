## Research Instructions Template

### For Agent 1 (Timing Analysis):
```
Analyze the timing synchronization between audio and text:
1. Examine hooks/useSentenceAnchoredAutoScroll.tsx for sentence timing
2. Review components/audio/InstantAudioPlayer.tsx for audio state
3. Investigate lib/audio/TimingCalibrator.ts for calibration logic
4. Document timing delays, race conditions, and synchronization points
5. Identify root causes of the 30% mismatch cases
```

### For Agent 2 (Scroll Behavior):
```
Investigate scroll behavior and DOM interactions:
1. Analyze how TextProcessor.splitIntoSentences differs from audio generation
2. Review DOM Range calculations in useSentenceAnchoredAutoScroll
3. Examine fallback mechanisms when sentence detection fails
4. Document scroll governors, debouncing, and hysteresis logic
5. Identify UI elements affecting scroll accuracy
```

### For Agent 3 (Calibration):
```
Research adaptive calibration mechanisms:
1. Review TimingCalibrator's sample collection and outlier removal
2. Analyze book-specific offset handling
3. Investigate confidence scoring and automatic adjustments
4. Document calibration persistence and storage
5. Propose improvements for the remaining 30% sync issues
```

## Key Findings from Previous Research

### Root Cause Identified
The primary issue was sentence boundary detection mismatches:
- Audio generation uses one method for splitting sentences
- Display uses TextProcessor.splitIntoSentences
- These methods disagree ~30% of the time on sentence boundaries

### Solution Implemented (Option 1)
- Integrated TextProcessor into useSentenceAnchoredAutoScroll
- Achieved 70% harmony improvement
- Remaining 30% requires deeper calibration research

### Proposed Option 2 Research Areas
1. **Dynamic Calibration Enhancement**
   - Real-time offset adjustment based on user interactions
   - Machine learning model for predicting optimal offsets
   - Book-specific timing profiles

2. **Sentence Boundary Reconciliation**
   - Unified sentence detection algorithm
   - Server-side sentence mapping generation
   - Client-side boundary correction

3. **Predictive Synchronization**
   - Anticipatory scroll based on reading speed
   - Voice cadence analysis
   - Adaptive timing windows
