## üéØ IDENTIFIED ISSUES (From Mobile Screenshots)

### 1. Ask AI Chat Modal (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Chat modal shows only half width
- **Problem**: Send button is cut off/not visible

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY MEASURES

### Git Safety Strategy:
1. **Backup branch**: `mobile-fixes-backup` (created from current main)
2. **Feature branch**: `fix-mobile-display` (for all changes)
3. **Frequent commits**: One fix per commit for easy rollback
4. **Clear commit messages**: Include scope and description

### Testing Protocol:
1. **Local testing**: After each change, test locally
2. **Mobile testing**: Test on actual mobile devices when possible
3. **Build verification**: Run build command after each commit
4. **Desktop verification**: Ensure desktop version unaffected
5. **Cross-browser testing**: Test on different mobile browsers

### Rollback Plan:
- Each change is a separate commit
- Easy to revert specific changes: `git revert <commit-hash>`
- Full rollback available: revert to backup branch
- Feature flags could be added if changes are complex

## üìÇ FILES TO INVESTIGATE

### Likely Components:
- Ask AI Chat: `/components/**/*Chat*`, `/components/**/*AI*`, `/components/**/*Modal*`
- Reading Page: `/app/library/[id]/read/page.tsx`, related CSS files
- Home Page: `/app/page.tsx`, `/components/**/*Book*`, `/components/**/*Enhanced*`
- Global Styles: `/app/globals.css`, `/styles/**/*.css`
- Mobile Styles: Files with mobile breakpoints, responsive utilities

### Investigation Questions:
1. How is the AI chat modal currently implemented?
2. What CSS controls the reading page layout?
3. Where are the mobile-specific styles defined?
4. Are there existing mobile breakpoints we should follow?
5. How are book cards styled differently on home vs collection pages?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Production Safety**: People are actively using the app
2. **Test Everything**: Every change must be thoroughly tested
3. **One Thing at a Time**: Complete each phase before moving to next
4. **Mobile First**: Test on actual mobile devices
5. **Preserve Functionality**: Don't break existing features
6. **Documentation**: Update this file as we progress
