# Audio Generation Implementation - Completion Report

## Summary
- Implementation completed across database, services, processor, admin API, and UI.
- Verified end-to-end: stats endpoint returns correct counts; backfill endpoint operational; files written to `public/audio/...`.
- Addressed Prisma pool exhaustion by consolidating to a singleton and using transactions for multi-query stats.

## What was completed
- Database: Added `audioFilePath`, `audioProvider`, `audioVoiceId` on `BookChunk`.
- Service: Implemented `lib/services/AudioGenerator` using OpenAI TTS; writes MP3s to `/public/audio/{bookId}/{cefrLevel}/chunk_{index}.mp3`.
- Processor: Extended `BookProcessor.processSimplificationJob` to generate audio and persist metadata; added `generateAudioForExistingChunks` backfill.
- API:
  - `POST /api/admin/audio/backfill` to generate missing audio.
  - `GET /api/admin/audio/stats` to report totals; refactored to a single transaction and distinct book counting.
- UI: Added `admin/audio` page and `AudioManagement` component; includes loading/error states and manual refresh.
- Prisma usage: Replaced ad-hoc `new PrismaClient()` with singleton `prisma` in runtime files; adjusted client to be pgbouncer-friendly.

## Verification
- Stats API local result: `{ totalSimplifiedChunks: 20, chunksWithAudio: 20, chunksWithoutAudio: 0, booksWithAudio: 1, audioPercentage: 100 }`.
- Backfill returned processed 20 with successes recorded, and files exist under `public/audio/gutenberg-1342/A1/`.
- UI fetch updated to `cache: 'no-store'` with cache-busting param and surfaced errors.

## Known minor issues / follow-ups
- Admin UI may cache old values in some browsers; added no-store and refresh control. Consider SWR/react-query for auto-revalidation.
- Concurrency: backfill currently sleeps 1s per chunk; parameterize throttle and add retry with exponential backoff.
- Storage: consider moving audio to Supabase Storage or CDN and store URLs; add cleanup tooling.
- Multi-voice support: expose voice selection in UI and validate via config.
- Monitoring: add metrics/logs for TTS failures and pool usage; surface in admin.

## Next steps
- Migrate stored audio to cloud storage and serve via CDN.
- Introduce job runner for resilient queue processing.
- Add unit/integration tests for AudioGenerator and stats route.
