## 🔄 CRITICAL UPDATES (Based on Expert Research)

### Timeline Extension: 10 weeks → 12 weeks
**Research Finding:** Original 10-week timeline was overly optimistic, particularly for legal setup and accessibility testing.

**Key Adjustments:**
- **Legal Phase Extended to 3 weeks** (from 2 weeks) - copyright consultations and DMCA setup require more time
- **Accessibility Testing Expanded** - continuous testing from Week 3 with multiple user feedback rounds
- **Soft Launch Added (Week 10)** - beta testing with 50 users before public launch
- **Buffer Time for Iterations** - allows for fixing accessibility issues and AI optimization

### AI Cost Optimization Strategy
**Research Finding:** AI costs can be controlled to under $1,200/month (76% below $5k budget) with proper optimization.

**Implementation:**
- **Smart Model Routing:** 70% queries → GPT-3.5-turbo, 30% → GPT-4o based on complexity
- **Aggressive Caching:** 80% cache hit rate target with Redis, 30-day TTL
- **Token Optimization:** 56% prompt token reduction, dynamic context management
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Daily budget limits with automatic cutoffs

### Enhanced Security Framework
**Research Gap Identified:** Original plan lacked comprehensive security practices.

**Security Additions:**
- **Week 2: Security Implementation** - Headers, rate limiting, input validation from day 1
- **Automated Dependency Scanning** - GitHub Actions with Snyk integration
- **Secrets Management** - Proper rotation schedule and environment validation
- **Security Monitoring** - Real-time threat detection and incident response

### Testing Strategy Overhaul
**Research Gap Identified:** No automated testing or CI/CD pipeline in original plan.

**Testing Enhancements:**
- **80% Code Coverage Target** with higher thresholds for accessibility components
- **Automated Accessibility Testing** - axe-core integration in CI/CD pipeline
- **E2E Testing with Assistive Technologies** - Screen reader compatibility verification
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing with accessibility features enabled

### Legal Precedent Integration
**Research Finding:** June 2025 Anthropic ruling provides clearer fair use guidelines.

**Legal Refinements:**
- **Educational Fair Use Strengthened** - Documented transformative use boundaries
- **Metadata-Only Storage** - Never store full copyrighted text, only references
- **Real-time Copyright Scanning** - Automated content filtering for outputs
- **Licensing-First Approach** - Public domain start, educational licenses negotiated

### Accessibility Architecture Enhancement
**Research Finding:** Component-level accessibility architecture provides competitive moat.

**Technical Improvements:**
- **Accessibility-First Component System** - Built-in ARIA support for all components
- **Multi-Modal Input Support** - Voice navigation, keyboard, touch, switch control
- **Real-time Screen Reader Integration** - Live regions and dynamic announcements
- **Advanced Personalization** - Dyslexia fonts, high contrast, motion preferences
