# Phase 4: Native Mobile App Research & Strategy
## Comprehensive Analysis for Native vs PWA Decision Making

---

## 🎯 **Research Mission & Context**

**Phase 4 Objective**: Determine the optimal mobile technology strategy for BookBridge by conducting comprehensive analysis of native mobile app development compared to the PWA approach defined in Phases 1-3.

**Current Context**: BookBridge has completed comprehensive mobile design research resulting in:
- **PWA-First Recommendation**: 60% cost reduction, 80-92% data savings, global accessibility
- **Complete Technical Specifications**: 56px sticky header, gesture patterns, cultural adaptations
- **Unified Implementation Roadmap**: 12-week development plan with WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- **Performance Targets**: <2s audio loading, <3s page load on 3G networks

**Critical Decision Point**: Should BookBridge implement the researched PWA solution immediately, or does native mobile app development provide compelling advantages that justify 60% higher development costs and longer implementation timeline?
