- **Right-to-left swipe** = Next page/chapter

**Cultural Sensitivity Analysis**:
- **LTR Reading Cultures** (English, Spanish, French): Intuitive match with reading direction
- **RTL Reading Cultures** (Arabic, Hebrew): Research shows users adapt to universal digital conventions rather than expecting mirrored behavior
- **Asian Markets** (China, Japan, Korea): Accept horizontal swipe conventions but prefer hierarchical navigation menus

**BookBridge Recommendation**:
```
Primary Navigation: Horizontal swipes (LTR=previous, RTL=next)
Sensitivity Threshold: 50px minimum horizontal displacement
Velocity Threshold: 200px/second minimum
Cultural Adaptation: Maintain universal direction but provide navigation menu alternatives
```

### A2. Gesture Conflict Resolution - SPECIFICATIONS

**Analysis of Leading Apps**:
- **Kindle**: Uses edge zones (outer 20% of screen) for swipe navigation, center 60% for text selection
