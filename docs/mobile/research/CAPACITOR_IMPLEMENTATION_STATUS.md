- Added network monitoring for adaptive quality
- Created lib/capacitor-storage.ts utility

**Day 5: File System Integration** ‚úÖ
- Enhanced CapacitorStorage with:
  - storeRawBookFile() / getRawBookFile() for PDFs/EPUBs
  - getAudioFile() for cached audio retrieval
  - listBookFiles() / deleteBookFiles() for management
- Integrated with BookProcessorService at lib/book-processor.ts:76,118
- Updated CapacitorAudioPlayer to use native storage

**Day 6: API Route Handling** ‚úÖ
- Created lib/api-adapter.ts for environment-aware routing
- Development: localhost:3000
- Production: bookbridge.onrender.com
- Updated core components:
  - app/page.tsx
  - components/AIChat.tsx
  - app/library/page.tsx
  - components/audio/InstantAudioPlayer.tsx

**Day 7: Final Features** ‚úÖ
- Created production/development Capacitor configs
- Added build:mobile script for production builds
- Enhanced useNetworkStatus hook with Capacitor support
- Created ShareButton component with native sharing

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- capacitor.config.ts
- capacitor.config.production.ts
- capacitor.config.development.ts
- components/CapacitorAppListener.tsx

- lib/capacitor-storage.ts
- lib/api-adapter.ts
- hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts (enhanced)
- Android/iOS native project structures

### Modified Files
- package.json (added Capacitor scripts)
