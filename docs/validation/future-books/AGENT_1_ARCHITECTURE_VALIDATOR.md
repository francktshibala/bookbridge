# Agent 1: Architecture Validator Instructions

## Your Mission
Validate that the proposed continuous scroll architecture with sentence-based storage will successfully eliminate chunk delays and create a Speechify-like reading experience.

## Context
**Current Problem**: BookBridge uses chunk-based architecture causing 0.5s delays between pages, breaking reading flow.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement continuous scroll with sentence-based architecture - no pages, just one infinite scrollable document.

## End Result We Want
- Entire book as continuous scroll (no chunks/pages)
- Click any sentence → audio starts in <100ms
- Perfect sync between audio and text
- 60fps scrolling on mobile devices
- Works with pre-generated audio (not real-time)

## Files You Must Review
1. `/docs/research/FUTURE_BOOKS_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md` - Complete implementation plan
2. `/docs/implementation/CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` (lines 443-756) - Implementation guide
3. `/docs/research/READING_FLOW_CONTINUITY_RESEARCH.md` - Current problems analysis
4. `/app/library/[id]/read/page.tsx` - Current reading page implementation

## Critical Questions to Investigate

### 1. Virtual Scrolling Feasibility
- Can React Window handle 1000+ page books smoothly?
- Will sentence-based rows work with variable heights?
- How to handle CEFR level switching in continuous scroll?

### 2. Database Schema Validation
- Is sentence-based storage optimal vs paragraph-based?
- How to ensure sentence boundaries match perfectly between audio and text?
- Storage requirements for 100+ books with 6 CEFR levels?

### 3. Migration Path
- How to migrate existing chunk-based books to continuous?
- Can we run both systems in parallel during transition?
- Data integrity during migration?

### 4. Mobile Performance
- Will virtual scrolling work on low-end phones (2GB RAM)?
- Touch scrolling smoothness with large documents?
- Memory management strategy for mobile?

## Research Areas
1. How does Kindle handle infinite scroll for large books?
2. Spotify's approach to gapless playback architecture
3. Medium.com's infinite scroll implementation
4. React Window vs Tanstack Virtual for book-length content
