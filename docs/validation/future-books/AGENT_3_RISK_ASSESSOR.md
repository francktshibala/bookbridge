# Agent 3: Risk Assessor Instructions

## Your Mission
Identify implementation risks, missing dependencies, timeline issues, and potential failure points in the 15-week future books plan.

## Context
**Implementation Plan**: 15-week transformation from chunk-based to continuous architecture at $121K investment.

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Must not break existing 10 enhanced books
- Zero downtime during migration
- Maintain current user reading progress
- Support rollback if issues arise

## Files You Must Review
1. `/docs/research/FUTURE_BOOKS_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md` - Full 15-week plan
2. `/docs/archived/AUDIO_PATH_CONFLICT_PREVENTION.md` - Past failures to avoid
3. `/PROGRESSIVE_VOICE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - URL parsing issues (lines 317-323)
4. `/docs/implementation/CHUNK_TRANSITION_FIX_PLAN.md` - Current rollback procedures

## Critical Risk Areas to Assess

### 1. Technical Risks
- Sentence tokenization consistency across all books
- Database migration for 100K+ existing records
- CDN costs with sentence-level files (10x more files)
- Browser compatibility for Web Audio API
- Service Worker complexity for offline mode

### 2. Timeline Risks (15 weeks)
- Week 1-6: Database schema - realistic?
- Week 7-10: Audio system - dependencies clear?
- Week 11-13: Migration - enough testing time?
- Week 14-15: Production rollout - buffer sufficient?

### 3. Migration Risks
- Data loss during chunk-to-sentence conversion
- User progress preservation
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Rollback complexity if issues found

### 4. Business Risks
- $121K budget overrun potential
- User experience during transition
- Competitor advancement during 15 weeks
- Technical debt accumulation

### 5. Hidden Dependencies
- Missing technical requirements?
- Third-party service limitations?
- Infrastructure scaling needs?
- Team skill gaps?

## Research Areas
1. Failed continuous scroll migrations (case studies)
2. Database migration horror stories and solutions
3. PWA offline audio streaming limitations
4. React virtual scrolling edge cases
5. Production rollback best practices

## Risk Mitigation Requirements
For each risk, identify:
- Probability (High/Medium/Low)
- Impact (Critical/Major/Minor)
- Detection method
- Prevention strategy
- Contingency plan
