## Executive Summary

Feasible with modifications. Achieving uninterrupted continuous reading with perfect audio sync on 2GB–8GB devices is practical using sentence-level audio, sliding-window virtualized text, and predictive prefetching. Required changes: dual-mode rollout (continuous + legacy chunks), strict mobile memory budgeting (≤100MB target), gapless playback with multi-audio queue scheduling, and aggressive device-first testing. Estimated timeline: 22–24 weeks. Budget: $180–$225K + 20–25% contingency.

Confidence: 82/100 with the plan below (65/100 if attempted under the prior 15-week/$121K plan).

## 1) Agent Findings Analysis

### Strengths
- Architecture (Agent 1): Sliding window + virtual scroll over sentence units aligns with Kindle/Medium approaches and supports precise sync.
- TDD (Agent 4): Clear blocking tests for <100ms start, 60fps, and gapless playback reduce risk.
- Performance (Agent 2): Focus on pre-generated CDN audio, ahead-of-need preloading, and variable-size virtualization.

### Weaknesses / Gaps
- Memory constraints (Agent 2): Underestimates DOM + text node + highlight overlay costs on 2GB devices; needs capped window size and measured quotas.
- Migration risk (Agent 3): No automated rollback, and limited plan for sentence-tokenization correctness across CEFR variants.
- iOS WebView realities: Autoplay policies and Web Audio quirks in Capacitor require explicit user-gesture bootstrap and multi-element HTMLAudio fallback.
- Highlighting strategy: Per-word DOM mutation is costly on mobile. Requires render-light approach (overlay or canvas-based map) and throttled updates.

### Conflicts
- Real-time vs pre-generated audio: All plans assume pre-generated; keep progressive generation only as a fallback in enhanced contexts.
- Sentence vs paragraph storage: Sentence granularity is optimal for sync but multiplies files; mitigate with bundling small sentences into compact segments (e.g., 3–5 sentences per asset) while maintaining word timings.

### Missing considerations
- Device-tiering: Adaptive window sizes and cache budgets by device capability.
- Network-aware prefetch: Integrate predictive prefetch ranges by effective network type (already scaffolded in repo).
- IndexedDB quota/back-pressure: Eviction and integrity under low storage.
- Accessibility QA: WCAG 2.1 AA and motion/animation preferences that impact auto-scroll.

## 2) Industry Research Integration

- Virtualized long text (Kindle/Medium): Use sentence or small paragraph rows with TanStack Virtual variable-size lists; maintain ~150–300 visible sentences max; measure and recycle nodes.
- Gapless mobile playback (Spotify/YouTube Music patterns): Preload next segment using multiple HTMLAudio elements (2–3 pool) with immediate handoff; small overlap/crossfade (5–20ms) to avoid click, scheduled via requestAnimationFrame.
- Mobile WebView constraints (iOS/Android):
  - Bootstrap audio on first tap; keep AudioContext unlocked.
  - Prefer HTMLAudio for decoded/mobile hardware paths; use Web Audio only for timing and soft-fade.
  - Avoid MSE for AAC/MP3 in iOS WebView for this use case; stick to file segments.
- Memory discipline: 50–100MB budget on low-end: DOM nodes <10k, keep text window small, unmount distant content, and clear audio buffers immediately after handoff.
- Offline/weak networks: Predictive prefetch of 2–10 sentences (network + speed dependent) with IndexedDB caching and quota-safe eviction.

Adopt: TanStack Virtual, multi-element audio queue, predictive prefetch + resource scheduler already scaffolded in repo (`lib/` prefetch/scheduler components).

Avoid: Full DOM per-word highlighting, large paragraph nodes without virtualization, and long-lived decoded AudioBuffer queues.

## 3) Definitive Implementation Plan (24 weeks)

### Phase 0 – Foundations (Weeks 1–2)
- Establish device-tiering matrix (2GB/3GB/4GB+): window sizes, cache quotas, CPU/Battery limits.
- Add bootstrap UX to unlock audio context on first tap; persist flag.
- Implement automated rollback scaffolding for data migrations.

### Phase 1 – Data & Storage (Weeks 3–6)
- Author sentence tokenizer with deterministic IDs; verify across CEFR variants; produce word timings schema.
- Storage design: Segment groups of 3–5 sentences per asset to reduce file count while retaining per-word timings.
- CDN layout + cache keys: book/level/chunk/sentenceGroup/version.
- Backfill pipeline for pilot titles; build verification reports (coverage, duration totals, checksum).

### Phase 2 – Mobile Virtual Reader (Weeks 7–10)
- Build sentence-virtualized reader (TanStack Virtual) with variable heights; sliding window target 150–300 sentences.
- Render-light highlighting: map-based or overlay component; throttle to ~10 Hz updates, driven by audio clock.
- Smooth auto-scroll: gentle, thresholded adjustments (already prototyped) tied to sentence progress.
- CEFR switch: retain scroll position via sentence IDs; re-map indexes without reflow spikes.

### Phase 3 – Audio Pipeline (Weeks 11–14)
- Multi-audio element queue (pool of 3) for gapless handoff; 5–20ms crossfade; HTMLAudio primary, Web Audio for timing/fade.
- Predictive prefetch integration: use `predictive-prefetch` ranges by network speed + reading speed.
- Resource scheduler tie-in: coordinate prefetch concurrency by network/battery (use `intelligent-resource-scheduler`).
- Strict cleanup: release previous element src, revoke object URLs, clear references on handoff.

### Phase 4 – Reliability, Offline, and Metrics (Weeks 15–18)
- IndexedDB caching with eviction (LRU per device tier); protect from quota errors.
- Background recovery: resume after network blips; skip-ahead logic on repeated failures.
- Performance monitors: FPS sampling, audio latency, buffer underruns; wire to existing monitoring system.
- Telemetry for prefetch accuracy and window churn.

### Phase 5 – TDD, QA, and Device Farm (Weeks 19–22)
- Implement Agent 4 tests: <100ms start (pre-gen), 60fps scroll under playback, gapless transitions, 30-min session, memory ≤100MB on 2GB device.
- Manual QA on iPhone SE (2nd gen), Android Go, Pixel class; test Capacitor WebView.
- Accessibility QA for motion, contrast, and dyslexia font impacts.

### Phase 6 – Pilot + Rollout (Weeks 23–24)
- Dual-mode release toggle: per-book and per-user opt-in to continuous.
- Migrate 5–10 pilot books; monitor metrics and user feedback.
- Prepare rollback scripts and data integrity checks; expand gradually.

## 4) Mobile Testing Strategy

- Device tiers: iOS SE/8/11+, Android 8–14, 2GB–8GB RAM; include Android Go.
- Automated: Jest + Playwright for timing harness; synthetic scroll and audio start timers; memory snapshots.
- Performance labs: Throttle CPU/network, long-session stability (30–60 min) with drift detection.
- Capacitor-focused runs: Validate autoplay gating, background/foreground transitions, interruptions.

---

## 5) Budget Breakdown (USD)

- Engineering (front-end + audio + infra): $135–$165K
- QA + Device Farm + Accessibility consulting: $25–$35K
- Content pipeline (tokenization, timings, backfill): $15–$20K
- Contingency (20–25%): $35–$50K

Total: $210–$270K. Lean path with stricter scope: $180–$225K + 20% contingency.

---

## 6) Risks and Mitigations

- Tokenization/timing mismatches: build deterministic tokenizer; run diff harness; reject drift >50ms at boundaries.
- Memory blowups on 2GB devices: enforce window caps; DOM node budget; monitor heap and auto-trim; disable heavy effects.
- iOS WebView audio quirks: user-gesture bootstrap; multi-audio pool fallback; avoid MSE; keep segments short (<20s).
- CDN/file explosion: bundle small sentence groups; gzip/br; signed immutable URLs; lifecycle policies.
- Offline quota errors: tiered eviction; graceful degradation to streaming-only when quota low.
- Migration safety: automated rollback scripts; dual-mode runtime; shadow data verification before switching defaults.

Go/No-Go gates: tests ≥95% pass on critical path; memory ≤100MB on 2GB devices; zero audible gaps detected by harness; accessibility checks passed.

---

## 7) Key Modifications to Agent Plans

- Enforce dual-mode rollout and automated rollback pre-implementation.
- Adopt multi-audio HTMLAudio queue with tiny crossfade; Web Audio only for timing/fades.
- Switch to render-light highlighting and throttle; avoid per-word DOM spans on mobile.
- Device-tiered virtualization and cache budgets; predictive prefetch integrated with scheduler.
- Segment audio into 3–5 sentence assets to balance file count with precise timings.

---

## 8) Integration Notes (Repo Alignment)

- Reader: migrate from chunk pages to sentence-virtualized list; reuse `AutoScrollHandler`; keep legacy chunk path as fallback (`app/library/[id]/read/page.tsx`).
- Audio: extend `components/audio/InstantAudioPlayer.tsx` to pool multiple audio elements and pre-bind next src for gapless handoff; wire `onWordHighlight` at 10Hz.
- Prefetch: leverage `lib/predictive-prefetch.ts`, `lib/intelligent-resource-scheduler.ts`, and `lib/audio-prefetch-service.ts` with network-aware ranges.
- Monitoring: use `lib/performance-monitoring-system.ts` to record audio latency, underruns, FPS, and memory.

## 9) Final Recommendation and Confidence

Proceed with the 24-week mobile-first plan above. Maintain dual-mode fallback, strict test gates, and strong rollback. Expected success confidence: 82/100 now; projected 88–90/100 after Phase 3 validations.
