# Book Simplification Accuracy Validation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist provides a systematic approach to validate the accuracy and quality of book simplifications across all CEFR levels (A1-C2) for the 10 enhanced books in BookBridge.

## Pre-Validation Setup

### 1. Test Book Information
- [ ] Document which 10 books have been simplified
- [ ] Note the era of each book (Early Modern, Victorian, American 19th Century, Modern)
- [ ] Record the total number of chunks per book at each CEFR level

### 2. Testing Tools Setup
- [ ] CEFR vocabulary validator (e.g., Text Inspector, Write & Improve)
- [ ] Readability calculator (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog)
- [ ] Word frequency analyzer
- [ ] Spreadsheet for tracking results

---

## Level-Specific Validation (Repeat for Each Book)

### A1 - Beginner Level Checks

#### Vocabulary Constraints
- [ ] Count unique words in 3 random chunks
- [ ] Verify ≤500 unique words are used
- [ ] Check against official A1 vocabulary lists (Cambridge English Profile)
- [ ] Flag any words outside A1 range

#### Sentence Structure
- [ ] Measure sentence length in 5 random paragraphs
- [ ] Confirm average is 5-8 words per sentence
- [ ] Verify no sentence exceeds 10 words
- [ ] Check for simple present tense usage only

#### Simplification Quality
- [ ] Original archaic words properly modernized (thou→you, hath→has)
- [ ] Complex concepts broken into simple statements
- [ ] No passive voice constructions
- [ ] Cultural references explained or removed

### A2 - Elementary Level Checks

#### Vocabulary Constraints
- [ ] Count unique words in 3 random chunks
- [ ] Verify 1000-1500 unique words are used
- [ ] Cross-reference with A2 vocabulary lists
- [ ] Ensure progression from A1 (more variety but still simple)

#### Sentence Structure
- [ ] Average sentence length 8-12 words
- [ ] Simple past and present tenses only
- [ ] Basic connectors used (and, but, because)
- [ ] No complex subordinate clauses

### B1 - Intermediate Level Checks

#### Vocabulary Constraints
- [ ] Verify ~2000 unique words
- [ ] Check for appropriate B1 vocabulary complexity
- [ ] Some phrasal verbs and idioms acceptable

#### Sentence Structure
- [ ] Sentences can be longer but still clear
- [ ] Most common tenses allowed
- [ ] Some complex sentences with clear connectors

### B2 - Upper-Intermediate Level Checks

#### Vocabulary Constraints
- [ ] ~2500-3000 unique words
- [ ] More sophisticated vocabulary retained
- [ ] Academic language simplified but present

#### Literary Preservation
- [ ] Original tone and style largely preserved
- [ ] Cultural references retained with context
- [ ] Literary devices simplified but not removed

### C1 - Advanced Level Checks

#### Minimal Changes
- [ ] ~4000 word vocabulary
- [ ] Only very complex structures simplified
- [ ] Implicit meanings made slightly more explicit
- [ ] Academic tone preserved

### C2 - Proficiency Level Checks

#### Polish Only
- [ ] Original text largely unchanged
- [ ] Only ambiguous expressions clarified
- [ ] Enhanced flow and coherence
- [ ] All literary complexity retained

---

## Cross-Level Validation

### Progressive Difficulty
- [ ] Read same passage at A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2
- [ ] Confirm smooth progression in complexity
- [ ] No sudden jumps in difficulty between levels
- [ ] Each level adds appropriate complexity

### Meaning Preservation
- [ ] Key plot points present at all levels
- [ ] Character names and relationships consistent
- [ ] Main themes identifiable even at A1
- [ ] No critical information lost in simplification

---

## Era-Specific Validation

### Victorian Literature (Pride & Prejudice, Frankenstein)
- [ ] Formal language appropriately modernized
- [ ] "Whilst" → "while", "shall" → "will" conversions
- [ ] Long sentences properly broken down
- [ ] Period-specific terms explained or simplified

### Early Modern English (Romeo & Juliet)
- [ ] Shakespeare's language fully modernized at A1-B1
- [ ] Archaic pronouns consistently updated
- [ ] Poetic elements preserved at higher levels
- [ ] Metaphors simplified or explained at lower levels

### American 19th Century (Little Women, Adventures of Tom Sawyer)
- [ ] Dialect and vernacular modernized
- [ ] Historical context preserved but clarified
- [ ] Colloquialisms updated for modern readers

---

## Technical Validation

### Readability Scores
For 3 sample chunks per level:
- [ ] Calculate Flesch Reading Ease score
- [ ] Calculate Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
- [ ] Verify progressive improvement A1→A2→B1→B2→C1→C2
- [ ] Document scores in tracking spreadsheet

### AI Quality Metrics
- [ ] Check similarity scores from API responses
- [ ] Note any "failed" quality flags
- [ ] Verify appropriate thresholds for each era/level combination
- [ ] Document retry attempts needed

---

## User Testing

### ESL Teacher Review
- [ ] Provide samples to 2-3 ESL teachers
- [ ] Get feedback on level appropriateness
- [ ] Note any vocabulary concerns
- [ ] Collect suggestions for improvement

### Student Testing (If Possible)
- [ ] A1 student reads A1 sample - comprehension check
- [ ] B1 student compares B1 vs original - preference check
- [ ] C1 student evaluates preservation of literary quality

---

## Final Quality Assurance

### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Same terms simplified consistently throughout book
- [ ] Character names never changed
- [ ] Formatting and structure preserved
- [ ] Chapter breaks maintained

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Check handling of dialogue
- [ ] Verify poetry/songs appropriately handled
- [ ] Test very short chunks (last chunk of chapters)
- [ ] Validate first chunk hooks readers appropriately

---

## Results Documentation

### Create Summary Report Including:
- [ ] Overall pass/fail for each book at each level
- [ ] Specific issues found and their severity
- [ ] Vocabulary accuracy percentage
- [ ] Sentence length compliance rate
- [ ] Meaning preservation score (subjective 1-10)
- [ ] Recommendations for improvement

### Data to Track per Book/Level:
```
Book: _______________ Level: _____
- Chunks tested: ___/___
- Vocabulary compliance: ___%
- Sentence length compliance: ___%
- Readability score: ___
- Teacher rating: ___/10
- Issues found: _____________
- Overall status: PASS / FAIL / NEEDS WORK
```

## Post-Validation Actions

### For Failed Validations:
1. Document specific failure points
2. Determine if issue is systematic or isolated
3. Flag for re-simplification if needed
4. Update prompts/thresholds if patterns emerge

### For Successful Validations:
1. Mark book/level as production-ready
2. Create sample excerpts for marketing
3. Document any exceptional quality examples
4. Share findings with development team
