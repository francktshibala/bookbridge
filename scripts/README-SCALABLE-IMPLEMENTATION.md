- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized batch inserts for large-scale processing
- **Connection Pooling**: Multiple connection types for read/write/bulk operations
- **Query Optimization**: Era-based filtering and level-specific queries

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Multi-Level Recovery System

#### 1. Automatic Retry Logic
```javascript
const getRetryConfig = (attemptNumber, baseTemp) => ({
  temperature: Math.max(0.1, baseTemp - (attemptNumber * 0.1)),
  delay: Math.pow(2, attemptNumber) * 1000, // Exponential backoff
  threshold: Math.max(0.65, baseThreshold - (attemptNumber * 0.02))
});
```

#### 2. State Persistence
- **Checkpoints**: Saved after each major phase completion
- **Progress State**: Continuously updated processing status
- **Error Logs**: Detailed failure information for analysis
- **Resume Capability**: Restart from any saved checkpoint

#### 3. Graceful Degradation
- **Partial Success Handling**: Continue processing when some items fail
- **Resource Management**: Adjust batch sizes based on performance
- **API Rate Limiting**: Dynamic delays based on response patterns
- **Quality Fallbacks**: Alternative validation when primary methods fail

### Recovery Strategies by Error Type

| Error Type | Recovery Strategy |
|------------|------------------|
| **API Rate Limit** | Exponential backoff with increased delays |
| **Database Timeout** | Reduce batch size and retry with smaller chunks |  
| **Quality Threshold Failure** | Adjust temperature and retry up to 3 times |
| **Network Issues** | Retry with progressive timeout increases |
| **Memory Issues** | Clear caches and process smaller batches |
| **Critical System Error** | Save state and enable manual recovery |

## Quality Assurance

### Era-Aware Quality Standards

Different literary eras require different quality thresholds due to language complexity:

- **Early Modern**: Lower thresholds (0.65-0.85) due to archaic language
- **Victorian**: Medium thresholds (0.70-0.86) for formal prose  
- **American 19th Century**: Higher thresholds (0.72-0.87) for mixed vernacular
- **Modern**: Highest thresholds (0.75-0.89) for contemporary language

### Content Preservation Validation

Critical elements monitored for preservation:
- **Negations**: not, never, no, none, isn't, aren't, won't, etc.
- **Conditionals**: if, unless, except, provided, whether, etc.
- **Quantifiers**: all, every, each, some, any, few, many, etc.
- **Temporal Markers**: before, after, during, while, when, etc.
- **Causal Relationships**: because, since, so, therefore, thus, etc.
- **Named Entities**: Proper nouns, numbers, specific references

### Quality Categories

| Score Range | Category | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **0.90+** | Excellent | Accept without review |
| **0.80-0.89** | Good | Accept with periodic sampling |
| **0.70-0.79** | Acceptable | Review for common patterns |
| **0.60-0.69** | Poor | Flag for manual review |
| **< 0.60** | Failed | Regenerate or exclude |
