# Help Us Make Books Accessible to Everyone

## Our Mission
**BookBridge believes that everyone deserves to understand and enjoy any book, regardless of their reading level, income, or where they live.**

We're building an AI-powered reading companion that helps people truly understand what they read - starting with the 1.5 billion people learning English worldwide. Whether you're 8 or 80, whether English is your first or fifth language, BookBridge adapts to help you learn.

**Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us closer to a world where no one is left behind in their reading journey.**
