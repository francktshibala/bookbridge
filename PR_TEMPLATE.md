# Add Capacitor for Native Mobile Apps

## 🚀 Overview
This PR implements Capacitor to transform BookBridge into native iOS/Android apps while maintaining 100% of the existing web functionality.

## ✅ What's Implemented
- **Capacitor Core Setup**: iOS and Android platform support
- **Native File Storage**: Offline book reading capability
- **Audio Caching**: Native audio storage for offline playback
- **API Routing**: Automatic dev/prod API switching
- **Network Monitoring**: Enhanced with native capabilities
- **Share Functionality**: Native sharing with web fallback
- **App Lifecycle**: Background/foreground handling

## 🔧 Technical Changes
