    long: `Once upon a time in a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived a young woman named Elara. She was known throughout the village for her extraordinary ability to communicate with animals. Birds would perch on her shoulders and sing melodies only she could understand, while rabbits and deer would gather around her cottage each morning, as if attending a daily meeting. The villagers, initially skeptical of her claims, soon came to rely on her unique gift when their livestock fell ill or when they needed help finding lost pets. Elara's connection with nature wasn't just limited to animals; she could sense changes in weather patterns days before they occurred and knew which herbs would bloom even before the first buds appeared. Her grandmother, who had raised her after her parents disappeared during a particularly harsh winter, always said that Elara had inherited this gift from a long line of forest guardians who had protected the village for generations.`,
