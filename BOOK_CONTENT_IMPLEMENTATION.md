# Book Content Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a book content loading system for BookBridge that enables the AI to answer questions about actual book content rather than just metadata.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Book Content API Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/books/[id]/content`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches book files from Supabase Storage
  - Supports query parameters:
    - `?chunks=true` - Returns content in chunks
    - `?query=<search>` - Finds relevant chunks based on query
  - Uses service role for bypassing RLS

### 2. Content Extraction Service
- **File**: `/lib/content-extractor.ts`
- **Supported formats**:
  - Plain text (.txt)
  - PDF files (.pdf) - using pdf-parse library
  - EPUB files (.epub) - using epub2 library
  - HTML files (.html, .htm)
- **Features**:
  - Extracts full text content
  - Preserves chapter structure for EPUBs
  - Basic language detection
  - Word count calculation

### 3. Content Chunking Service
- **File**: `/lib/content-chunker.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Splits large books into manageable chunks (default: 1500 words)
  - Overlap between chunks for context continuity (default: 200 words)
  - Preserves sentence and paragraph boundaries
  - Finds relevant chunks based on keyword search
  - Creates AI-friendly context from chunks

### 4. Enhanced AI Integration
- **Modified**: `/app/api/ai/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automatically fetches relevant book content when bookId is provided
  - Searches for chunks related to the user's query
  - Provides up to 3000 words of context to the AI
  - Falls back gracefully if content fetch fails

## How It Works

1. **User asks a question** about a book in the AI chat
2. **AI API receives** the query with bookId
3. **Content is fetched** from the book content API with the query
4. **Relevant chunks** are found based on the question
5. **Context is created** from the most relevant chunks
6. **AI receives** the enriched context and can quote actual book passages

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Fetch full book content
GET /api/books/[bookId]/content

// Fetch chunks with relevance to a query
GET /api/books/[bookId]/content?query=what+is+the+main+theme&chunks=true

// Response includes:
{
  "id": "book-id",
  "title": "Book Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "chunks": [...relevant chunks...],
  "context": "Formatted context for AI",
  "totalChunks": 150,
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

## Next Steps (Remaining TODOs)

1. **Content Caching** - Cache extracted content to avoid re-processing
2. **Book Reader UI** - Display book content for users to read
3. **Semantic Search** - Implement vector-based search for better relevance
4. **Content Indexing** - Add database indexing for faster retrieval

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-book-content.ts
```

This tests text extraction, chunking, and relevance finding capabilities.
