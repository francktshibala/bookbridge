# BookBridge iOS In-App Purchase Implementation Plan

*Based on comprehensive research findings from Agent 1 (iOS Native), Agent 2 (Backend), and Agent 3 (UX/Business)*

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Implement dual payment system (Apple IAP + Stripe) to resolve iOS App Store rejection while maintaining cross-platform functionality.

**Timeline**:
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: 2 days implementation
- ⏳ **NEXT**: Native iOS build & testing (1-2 hours)
- ⏳ **FUTURE**: App Store resubmission

---

## Phase 1: Backend Integration (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Apply Database Schema Changes ✅ COMPLETED
```bash
# ✅ COMPLETED: Applied Agent 2's schema changes
# Supabase SQL Editor executed: supabase/APPLE_IAP_SCHEMA.sql
```

**Files integrated:**
- ✅ `types/subscription.ts` (updated with Apple fields)
- ✅ `lib/apple-server-api.ts` (JWT helper for Apple Server API)
- ✅ `app/api/apple/link/route.ts` (link Apple transactions to users)
- ✅ `app/api/apple/notifications/route.ts` (handle Apple server notifications)

### 1.2 Environment Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
```bash
# ✅ COMPLETED: Apple IAP keys not needed for basic implementation
# Basic IAP functionality works without Apple Developer keys
# Keys only needed for advanced server-to-server validation
```

### 1.3 Install Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED
```bash
# ✅ COMPLETED: Installed by Agent 2
npm install jsonwebtoken @types/jsonwebtoken
```

**✅ Backend Status**: Complete implementation provided by Agent 2

---

## Phase 2: iOS Native Implementation (Day 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Install Capacitor Subscriptions Plugin ✅ COMPLETED
Based on Agent 1 research - using lightweight option:
```bash
# ✅ COMPLETED: Plugin installed and synced
npm install @squareetlabs/capacitor-subscriptions
npx cap sync ios
```

### 2.2 iOS Configuration (Xcode) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. ✅ Select App target → Capabilities → Enable "In-App Purchase"
3. ✅ Verify iOS Deployment Target is 15.0+ (required for StoreKit 2)

### 2.3 Create Subscription Products (App Store Connect) ✅ COMPLETED
**Product created:**
- ✅ Product ID: `bookbridge_premium_v2`
- ✅ Price: $3.99 USD (Apple's closest to $4 after fees)
- ✅ Duration: 1 month
- ✅ Auto-renewable: Yes
- ✅ Reference Name: "BookBridge Premium Monthly"
- ✅ Description: "Unlimited books, voice features, and premium AI tutoring"

### 2.4 Implement iOS Purchase Logic ✅ COMPLETED
✅ Created `lib/ios-subscription.ts` with:
- Product fetching (`getProductDetails()`)
- Purchase handling (`purchaseSubscription()`)
- Current entitlements (`getCurrentEntitlements()`)
- Backend integration with Agent 2's `/api/apple/link` endpoint

### 2.5 Platform Detection Utilities ✅ COMPLETED
✅ Created `lib/platform-utils.ts` with:
- iOS detection (`isIOS()`)
- Capacitor app detection (`isCapacitor()`)
- Payment method routing (`shouldShowApplePurchase()`)

### 2.6 Test Page Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
✅ Created `app/test-iap/page.tsx` with:
- Platform detection verification
- Test product details fetching
- Test purchase functionality
- Test current entitlements checking
- **Result**: Successfully shows "incompatible with web" error (expected)

---

## Phase 3: Native iOS Build & Testing ⏳ NEXT PHASE

### 3.1 Build Native iOS App
**Critical Step**: IAP only works in native iOS builds, not web browsers
```bash
# Build for iOS
npx cap build ios
npx cap open ios

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select target device (iOS Simulator or real device)
# 2. Build and run (⌘+R)
# 3. Navigate to test page in native app
# 4. Test IAP functionality
```

### 3.2 iOS Sandbox Testing
1. **Configure Sandbox Account**: Settings → Developer → Sandbox Apple Account
2. **Test Scenarios in Native App**:
   - ✅ Product details fetch
   - ⏳ Purchase subscription ($3.99)
   - ⏳ Restore purchases
   - ⏳ Backend sync verification

### 3.3 Platform Detection (ALREADY COMPLETE)
✅ `lib/platform-utils.ts` already created with:
```typescript
export const isIOS = (): boolean => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false;
  return /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);
};

export const shouldShowApplePurchase = (): 'apple' | 'stripe' => {
  return getPaymentMethod() === 'apple';
};
```

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Integration (Future Phase)

### 4.1 Update Pricing Page
Modify `app/subscription/pricing/page.tsx`:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useSubscription } from '@/hooks/useSubscription';
import { isIOS, getPaymentMethod } from '@/lib/platform-utils';
import { IOSSubscriptionService } from '@/lib/ios-subscription';

export default function PricingPage() {
  const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState<'apple' | 'stripe'>('stripe');
  const { user } = useSubscription();

  useEffect(() => {
    setPaymentMethod(getPaymentMethod());
  }, []);

  const handleSubscribe = async (tier: 'premium' | 'student') => {
    if (!user) {
      window.location.href = '/auth/login';
      return;
    }

    if (paymentMethod === 'apple') {
      // iOS App Store purchase
      const productId = tier === 'premium'
        ? 'bookbridge_premium_monthly'
        : 'bookbridge_student_monthly';

      try {
        await IOSSubscriptionService.purchaseSubscription(productId, user.id);
      } catch (error) {
        alert('Purchase failed. Please try again.');
      }
    } else {
      // Existing Stripe flow
      // ... existing Stripe code
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Pricing cards */}
      {paymentMethod === 'apple' && (
        <button onClick={() => IOSSubscriptionService.restorePurchases()}>
          Restore Purchases
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3.3 Update Subscription Hook
Modify `hooks/useSubscription.ts` to check both Stripe and Apple subscriptions:

```typescript
// Add Apple subscription status checking
const checkAppleSubscription = async () => {
  if (isIOS()) {
    try {
      const restored = await IOSSubscriptionService.restorePurchases();
      // Update subscription status based on restored purchases
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to check Apple subscription:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

---

## Phase 5: Production Testing Strategy (Future)

### 4.1 Sandbox Testing Setup
1. **App Store Connect**: Ensure products are "Ready to Submit"
2. **iOS Device**: Configure sandbox account in Settings → Developer → Sandbox Apple Account
3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Purchase premium subscription
   - Purchase student subscription
   - Restore purchases
   - Cross-platform access (purchase on iOS, access on web)

### 4.2 TestFlight Testing
**Note**: Based on Agent 1 research, TestFlight renewals now happen every 24 hours (slower testing)

1. Upload build to TestFlight
2. Test subscription lifecycle
3. Verify backend sync between Apple and Supabase

### 4.3 Error Handling Testing
- Network failures during purchase
- Invalid product IDs
- User cancellation
- Parental controls blocking purchase

---

## Phase 6: Production Deployment (Future)

### 5.1 Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
# Production values
APPLE_IAP_KEY_ID=production_key_id
APPLE_IAP_ISSUER_ID=production_issuer_id
APPLE_IAP_PRIVATE_KEY="production_private_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IOS_BUNDLE_ID=com.francois.bookbridge
```

### 5.2 App Store Connect Final Setup
1. Set subscription products to "Ready to Submit"
2. Configure App Store Connect subscription groups
3. Set up App Store Server Notifications URL: `https://yourapp.com/api/apple/notifications`

### 5.3 Build and Submit
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
npx cap copy ios
npx cap open ios

# In Xcode:
# 1. Archive the app
# 2. Upload to App Store Connect
# 3. Submit for review
```
