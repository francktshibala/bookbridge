## **🔄 What Needs to be Done Next (10-15 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Run the database migration
psql -d bookbridge -f progressive-voice-database-migration.sql
```

### **Step 2: Initialize Pre-Generation (5 minutes)**
```javascript
// Trigger Pride & Prejudice pre-generation (run once in browser console)
fetch('/api/audio/pregenerated', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    bookId: 'pride-prejudice', // Update with actual book ID from URL
    totalChunks: 459
  })
});
```

### **Step 3: Test Complete System (5 minutes)**
- Navigate to Pride & Prejudice reading page
- Click the blue play button → Should start audio in <2 seconds
- Words should highlight in green with Speechify-style animation
- Auto-advance should work smoothly between chunks
- Test different CEFR levels and voices
