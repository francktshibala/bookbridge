# BookBridge Upload Issue Documentation

## üìã Status: UNRESOLVED
**Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Issue**: Book upload failing with RLS policy violation despite service role key usage

## ‚úÖ What We Successfully Accomplished

### 1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**
- ‚úÖ **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Fixed PostCSS plugin error by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- ‚úÖ **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Updated Supabase server client to use `await cookies()` for new API
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Middleware**: Created `middleware.ts` with proper route protection
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Component**: Built responsive navigation with user menu and auth status
- ‚úÖ **Layout Updates**: Fixed viewport warnings and integrated navigation component
- ‚úÖ **CSS Classes**: Defined missing `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary` classes in globals.css

### 2. **Database & Storage Setup**
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Connection**: Database connection working (verified with `npx prisma db push`)
- ‚úÖ **Storage Bucket**: `book-files` bucket exists and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Storage RLS**: Disabled storage RLS by making bucket public
- ‚úÖ **Service Role Key**: Correctly configured and accessible

### 3. **Upload Endpoint Implementation**
- ‚úÖ **File Validation**: Proper validation for file type (PDF, TXT, HTML) and size (10MB limit)
- ‚úÖ **Service Role Usage**: Implemented service role client to bypass RLS
- ‚úÖ **Timestamp Fields**: Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to database insert
- ‚úÖ **UUID Generation**: Manual ID generation since CUID default not working
- ‚úÖ **File Storage**: Successfully uploading files to Supabase storage

## ‚ùå Current Problem: RLS Policy Violation

### Error Details
```
File upload error: {
  statusCode: '403',
  error: 'Unauthorized', 
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy'
}
```

### What We Tried
1. **Service Role Implementation**: Used `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which should bypass RLS
2. **Database Field Completion**: Added all required fields including timestamps
3. **Storage RLS Disabled**: Made storage bucket public
4. **Direct Testing**: Verified service role key works in standalone scripts

### Paradox: Working vs. Not Working
- ‚úÖ **Standalone Script**: Service role key successfully inserts records
- ‚ùå **Upload Endpoint**: Same service role key fails with RLS violation

### Technical Investigation
- **Service Role Key**: Verified present and correct format
- **Database Insert**: All required fields provided
- **Field Debugging**: Added logging to track exact data being sent
- **RLS Policies**: No explicit policies blocking inserts found

## üìù Next Steps for Resolution

### Option 1: Bypass Database RLS Entirely
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE books DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Option 2: Create Explicit Allow Policy
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on books" ON books
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Option 3: Debug Service Role Context
- Add more detailed logging to understand why service role isn't working in upload context
- Check if there's a difference in how the service role key is being used

### Option 4: Alternative Database Approach
- Use Prisma instead of direct Supabase client
- Create a separate database user with explicit permissions

## üîÑ Current State

**Authentication Flow**: ‚úÖ Working  
**Navigation**: ‚úÖ Working  
**File Upload UI**: ‚úÖ Working  
**File Storage**: ‚úÖ Working  
**Database Insert**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED by RLS**  

## üí° Recommended Resolution Priority

1. **High Priority**: Run SQL commands to disable RLS on books table
2. **Medium Priority**: Create explicit allow policies
3. **Low Priority**: Investigate service role context differences

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

- `middleware.ts` - Authentication protection
- `components/Navigation.tsx` - User navigation
- `app/layout.tsx` - Layout with navigation
- `app/globals.css` - CSS classes and styles
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Fixed cookies API
- `app/api/books/upload/route.ts` - Upload endpoint with service role
- `postcss.config.js` - Fixed Tailwind plugin

## üéØ Impact

**Blocking**: Complete user flow testing  
**Workaround**: None currently available  
**User Experience**: Cannot upload books or test AI chat functionality

*This issue prevents completion of the MVP functionality. The core infrastructure is solid, but the database RLS policy is the final blocker.*
